## About

Sublinks, crafted using Java Spring Boot, stands as a state-of-the-art link
aggregation and microblogging platform, reminiscent yet advanced compared to
Lemmy & Kbin. It features a Lemmy compatible API, allowing for seamless
integration and migration for existing Lemmy users. Unique to Sublinks are its
enhanced moderation tools, tailored to provide a safe and manageable online
community space. Embracing the fediverse, it supports the ActivityPub protocol,

### Developer Setup

#### Linux

TBD

#### macOS

TBD

#### Windows

TBD

### Docker Setup (for dependencies)

To use this Docker setup you first need to complete a few steps:

- Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to pull down all submodules
- Create and configure your `.env` file:
  - `A=FOO`
  - `B=BAR`
  - `etc`
  - This section might need us to re-work
- `API_HOST=host.docker.internal docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.backend.yaml up [-d]`
    - `-d` to run in detached mode (don't include the [] brackets, they indicate
      being optional)
    - NOTE: The UI service will fail unless the API is already running. However,
      the API will complain if the database is not running. However, it is recommended
      to run the API first and ignore the errors until the database is running

### Run

- Run `./gradlew bootRun`
- Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)
